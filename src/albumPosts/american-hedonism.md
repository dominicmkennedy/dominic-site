## Provenance

My friend [John](https://johnallbritten.com/) showed me the band Your Neighbors a few weeks ago (still making this a human recommendation, just not mine).
More importantly, they released this album three days ago!
So you can listen to it with that smug sense of superiority you get from listening to a brand-new, underground indie album no one has heard of (unless your friends also read this blog).
If that's not smugly superior enough for you, [A Love Supreme](https://www.honest-broker.com/p/john-coltranes-love-is-still-supreme) turned 60 this week, so you can listen to that instead.

## Worth the Listen

I just called this an indie album, and in a way, it is, but the album--and the band, more generally--spends a lot of time playing across genres.
Usually, this is a detriment to albums; cross-genre playing is distracting and typically indicative of a lack of artistic direction.
But this is not so for Your Neighbors; while they may not have a genre, they certainly do have a vision.

*AMERICAN HEDONISM* is musically cohesive track-to-track despite the frequent stylistic shifts (primarily between hyperpop and indie).
In fact, Your Neighbors uses an element of each genre to their advantage, as *AMERICAN HEDONISM* is far more narrative-focused than any other hyperpop album I've heard and, frankly speaking, a lot more fun than most indie I hear.

A few album standouts:

* *NO DICE* has a lot of stylistic elements that remind me of some of my favorite Magdalena Bay songs, all with a very polished production.
* *KILLSWITCH* is fun and, fast, and dancey, and it's perfectly squished between two very indie tracks, *SARAH* and *ANGUISH*.
