## Prelude

I would like to thank my friend Rose for introducing me to the genre of [City pop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_pop). I was originally using it as background music for work since the non-English lyrics don't distract me. While listening to different City pop playlists I stumbled across [Makoto Matsushita](https://www.last.fm/music/Makoto+Matsushita)'s works multiple times. On a whim I elected to give this album a spin.

I likely won’t make a point of discussing the album art of each album I review. But I’d like to call to your attention, the few colors and simple geometry representing a landscape comprising this album cover, is reminiscent of some rather sound [vexillological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vexillology) principles. While I enjoy the album art, for its simplicity, recognizability, and serene beauty, I'm sure [J.J. would have a fit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRtUiORUh7c).

## Tracklist

1. **First Light**

We begin with a fun, rhythmically inspiring intro. It is however not fun enough to warrant the 30 seconds that it consumes on the first track. The first verse is fun and catchy, but nothing to write home about (yet here I am). After the second verse we are treated to a trumpet solo. My complaint of this solo hinges on the rhythm section. They make no effort to have an improvisational conversation with the trumpet soloist, instead opting for stagnant background chords. Effectively leaving the trumpet out to dry.

Overall the tune has catchy lyrics, but the wanting solo makes me feel like I’m listening to *regular* pop not *city* pop.

2. **One Hot Love**

Compared to the preceding track, “One Hot Love” has a much more enticing intro. As we drop into the first verse the composition becomes more simple, with just enough guitar and bass to outline the chord structure. The change of pace is refreshing, but the real boon to this simplistic scheme is how comfortably the group sits in the pocket, giving us a much tighter rhythm than what could be felt in the previous track. The conclusion of the second verse brings us to another vapid solo, this time courtesy of the guitarist. Each *A* chorus has concluded with the singer exclaiming about their “One Hot Love”, and the third *A* chorus is no exception. Even though it is expected at this point I the refrain is still fun and catchy.

3. **Resort for Blue**

I generally really enjoy short instrumental interludes, but this one leaves me wanting, due to its sluggish feel. It also comes too early on in the album. I’d probably enjoy it more if it was the sixth or seventh track.

If it had been recorded this year, an enterprising young producer would include a compressed track of two people having a quiet conversation overtop of the music.

4. **September Rain**

A four part choral harmony, with a soothing synth patch floating overtop. This is by far the best intro on this album yet. After some nifty base lines the intro gives way to the first verse, where the singer tells about summer giving way to the September rain. Just like clockwork after the first two verses it’s time for a solo in the bridge section. This time is different, as a  flugelhorn plays a far more appropriate solo then what was accomplished by the guitarist on “One Hot Love”. Comparatively speaking this track has a more relaxed tempo, milder timbres, and almost no syncopation. It plays more like a jazz ballad, and the execution is spot on.

`+10` points for including both trumpets and flugelhorns in your album.

5. **Lazy Night**

I am known amongst my friends to tell long winded stories that will ultimately go nowhere. There’s no takeaway, no lesson, no punchline. I begin the story, time passes, I finish the story. Nothing has changed save for the passage of time. One big nothingburger if you will. This song is a nothingburger, it’s a rollercoaster restricted to movement in one axis. It is the worst song on this album.

Also the bassist stomps over all the other musicians like a dancer with two left feet.

6. **This Is All I Have for You**

At this point in the album I feel as though we’re just rehashing the earlier tracks, a syncopated intro that takes us into an *AABA* song form with a solo over the bridge. Fortunately this track is able to keep things somewhat fresh with oodles of fun guitar riffs sprinkled throughout. Additionally the synth solo in this track easily eclipses the solos from “First Light” and “One Hot Love”, not that it’s blow-your-socks-off amazing, but the improvisational bar is pretty low on this album.

One last thing I’d like to note is the set of toms that play a fairly busy beat throughout the song; it's light enough in the mix so as not to stand out over the other instruments. But soft as they are, the toms are really the ones driving the bus, not the drummer or bassist. Without their inclusion the track would crawl along at a glacial pace.

7. **I Know…**

The first quarter of this track only features Matsushita's voice and some light keyboard comping. Making it the most intimate track thus far. These two are then joined by some back up vocalists. The additional vocal power helps in building up tension with louder dynamics, and the use of some more colorful chords. The building tension is finally resolved with the word painting of Matsushita singing “Stop.” Signaling a brief pause. Following this pause Matsushita thrice sings the question, “Where should you go?” The sameness of the lyrics are contrasted with the wildly different chords that accompany each iteration of the question. Each chord is spicier than the one preceding it, bringing us far beyond the tension achieved before. Maybe the chords increase in complexity to signal the singer's increased consternation over the question. Maybe the chords increase in complexity because it is musically brilliant `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`. The ballad is resolved with the same lyrics it started with, “I know…” What a beautifully poetic touch.

This is by far the best track on the album, it is also the only track to be without a bass part. Coincidence?

8. **Love Was Really Gone**

During the opening, and through to the end of the first chorus, harmonic comping is provided by a few violins. Superficially this is a good idea, as the timbre of the violins provides a nice textural variation. Unfortunately during what would be an otherwise soft and understated introduction, the bass player is absolutely hellbent on playing syncopated rhythms with the most aggressively snappy articulation. Adding insult to injury, these rhythmically inappropriate lines are far too loud in the mix, drowning out the poor violins. Thankfully once we move into the second chorus, the violins are swapped for vocalists, and the rest of the band has a nice dynamic build up, putting everyone on more equal footing.

The bridge features a well executed synth solo, and at its conclusion we’re back to the violin based harmony and obnoxious bass, how upsetting. The track just lost all sense of momentum. On an uplifting note, after the final chorus everyone but the violins drop and the tempo slows, as we are treated to an elegant outro. It's a nice resolution to the previous bout of musical angst.

9. **Sunset**

What a delightfully spooky intro. I’d also like to highlight a particularly creative feature that plays twice per chorus in which the drums and bass play one measure of double time, which is followed by a two measure piano motif played in half-time. You might think that this time contrasting call and response pattern would be nauseating, but I find it keeps up rhythmic interest on a track that may otherwise drag (8 minutes is a long time for a pop song).

After the halfway point we are treated to a cannon of Matsushita singing "Here comes the sunset." It's well executed, but I can't help but imagine what the chord progression might hold if instead [Jacob Collier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Collier) were the one to write this song.

10. **September Rain (Japanese Version)**

Not much to be said about this track that I didn't say about the other version, it's just a lyric swap. Although a cursory listen reveals that it is an entirely new take, and not just a redub. The other notable information gleaned from this listen is rather disappointing. The flugelhorn solo is note for note the same in both versions `:/`.

I'm ranking the Japanese version higher since I don’t have to cringe at the corny lyrics in this version.

## Conclusion

### Things I did not like

* **Lack of risk taking**

Save for tracks like “I Know” and “Sunset” I was hard pressed to find interesting chord progressions, or rhythms any more complex than some simple syncopation.

* **Bass volume**

I have not listened to the original 1982 master of *First Light*, so I’m not sure if it was a problem then too, but the bass player is consistently far louder than need be. It constantly distracts from the artistry of the other players.

* **Weak solos**

The rhythm section makes no discernable effort to communicate with the soloist, and the audience is left with musicians playing past each other. I enjoyed the keyboard solos much more than either the trumpet and guitar solos. Likely because the keyboardist is able to provide some of their own comping during the solo, a luxury the other soloists are without.

### Things I did like

* **Playing in the pocket**

Keeping tight time is paramount to the vibe of City pop, or any rhythmically inclined music. The players take this to heart by keeping a tight groove for the duration of the album.

* **Matsushita’s voice**

Listening to the album I thought I’d get tired of hearing the same voice droning on. That was not the case at all as I came to really appreciate Matsushita’s serenading more and more throughout my listening.

* **Vocal ballads**

The ballads were a standout feature on this album. While Matsushita’s aforementioned voice is certainly a contributing factor. The real boon of the ballads came from the artistic liberties they took.

### Rating

Overall I’m giving *First Light* 2.5 stars. Every track does an excellent job of nailing that ever elusive city pop vibe, and it's no easy feat to cop those city pop chops.
