# *{title}* by {credits}

## Prelude

Charli XCX was my top Spotify artist of 2023, so making a review of this album was practically mandatory.

## Tracklist

1. **Sentence**

The opening cacophony of this track is far too loud. This is doubly a shame since I like what it's going for, setting the tone of the album to come. The snare sample attempts much of the same tone setting but has much better execution. The sample sounds like a white noise generator but with the transience of an acoustic snare hit.

The drum beat is trying to drive us at a quick-ish pace, close to a jog. But the attempt is so thinly veiled that the effect falls flat on its face. This drum beat stays the same for the majority of the track, making it not only frustrating but stagnant as well.

2. **Immortal**

The whole *tuning the radio* to lead into a song is a tired trope; please stop using it.

The bass synth on this song is wonderful. It has a punchy, explosive attack, but the sustain is warm and vibrant. It's a little bit like the pluck of an electric bass, followed by the bowing of an upright bass. Because the bass has such a stiff articulation, it can fully support the rhythm during chorus sections. During the verses, rhythmic duty is handed off, not to the drums, but to the guitar. Since either bass or guitar supports the rhythm at any given moment, the song's percussion track is entirely superfluous. This is a great boon to the song's ambiance since the percussion track is freed up to add flourishes instead. During the verses, these flourishes take the form of appropriately small clicks and ticks. Otherwise, the drums play a snare hit with incredible power, further selling the chorus section's higher-energy nature.

3. **Reign**

This track starts with just a sub-bass and chimes overhead. Leaving the middle of the frequency spectrum empty. The lack of more percussion at the beginning of the track leaves room for rhythmic interpretation; similarly, the lack of melodic instruments does the same for the chord progression. Remedying this, the gaps are filled with a sharp synthetic snare sample and a mid-range synth to flesh out the harmonic progression, which was only hinted at by the sub-bass prior. I enjoy the sound of the mid-range synth that carries the melody. It sounds kind of like a voice vocoded by a guitar with lots of distortion. On the other hand, the sub-bass sounds awful with its Skillex-esque *wub-dub* sound.

Nothing of note occurs after introducing all of our synths and samples. Don't get me wrong, the soundscape here is *cool*, but it doesn't serve the song; it just exists to sound cool. It's not their fault either; there's no song to serve, no sick-nasty chord progression, no rhythmic excitement. I hate saying all this because I love an instrumental track dropped into an album to shake things up. However, this song is stagnant; the only thing shaking *it* up is a halftime feel during the breakdown that features the atrocious *wub-dub* sub-bass.

4. **Heavy**

This song sounds like it was supposed to go on a Charli XCX album. Even more than that, it feels like, in an attempt to hide this fact, all of the drum samples in the project were swapped for default trap drum samples. But this is very much to the song's advantage. The song has more dynamic variation than any other in the album, and the trap drums always cut through the mix, so the song maintains remarkable clarity. On the subject of clarity, my favorite effect in this song is the vocal treatment. Charli's vocals are always doubled up, with one set left mostly untouched while the other is heavily distorted. This yields a unique timbre for the vocals while still allowing the lyrics to be understood. Doubling the vocals also gives them a full, omnipresent sound.

5. **Bullets**

The acoustic guitar is intentionally at odds with the synth drums in this song. Highlighting this disparity are the vocals, which remain natural in the verses but have a distortion effect applied in the choruses. The effect works well since the guitar always cuts through the mix, regardless of how loud any other elements become. This sonic contrast of analog and digital is highly reminiscent of [Adam Neely's cover of Clarity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PP66CIzjOS8) (I highly recommend a listen, by the way).

`-10 points` for the *stomp clap stomp-stomp clap* beat running throughout the song; *it* is highly reminiscent of a high school pep rally.

6. **If I Knew**

The bass in this track has such a warm tone; it almost sounds like an upright bass being bowed. This, combined with the particular vocal processing, makes the beginning of the track sound like a Jacob Collier song. During the verses, a synth arpeggiates the chords; this, combined with the chord progression itself, *almost* sounds like [shepherd tones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shepard_tone); this compositional trick gives the song a very hopeful theme. The drums also really **drive** here, adding energy to our hope.

The choruses are a massive tonal shift, moving into a particularly moody chord progression. If you bother to listen to the lyrics, you'll notice they have a similar verse-to-chorus tonal shift; if you don't listen to the lyrics, you're not missing much. Halfway through the chorus, the synth arpeggiation reappears, and the drums start playing a four-on-the-floor groove. Calling it a groove might be a bit generous; the kick drum plays four quarter notes, one on each beat, and that is the only thing the drums play for the chorus. These two elements brighten the mood and up the energy.

The part of this track I enjoy the most is the transitional contrast. The verse-to-chorus transition throws you off an emotional cliff. Comparatively, chorus-to-verse opts for a slow and steady sonic build-up.

7. **Flail**

The drum track makes it feel like something is barreling towards me at high speed. It's the most exciting part of the song, which is probably why the song begins with four measures of the drums alone. Other than that, the song doesn't do anything of note, so I am glad the bass sound is the same as in the last song, *If I Knew*.

8. **Lost Everything**

This also sounds like it should have been on a Charli XCX album. I'm impressed by the constant stream of 16th notes. They exist to outline the chord structure and keep pace, but they avoid becoming a drone by changing volume and tone as appropriate. The post-chorus lyric repetition of "You've got everything" and "But you've lost everything" also gets a pass from being too repetitive since the constantly changing background instrumentation breaks up the monotony and makes the vocals fade into the background.

9. **O Fortuna**

This song sounds like it came from the token "calm" song in a heavy metal or prog rock album. "System of A Down" or "Dream Theater" vibes. The chorus sees the addition of percussion. To mirror the lyrical content of the chorus. The percussion plays a distinctly lopsided rhythm, like someone with an injured leg ambling along. The effect is a little gratuitous, but it's pulled off well, so it gets a pass. There's a synth solo after each chorus, the second of which has a cool effect where each note is also played down a minor third, adding to the song's tension.

I enjoy the song well enough, but it’s so out of place in this album.

10. **Shine a Light**

After the intro, once the vocals enter, this song opts for a traditional pop chord progression but with a beat and samples from 2010s-era house music; but, in true hyperpop fashion, something is *just* off; in this case, the vocals are slightly de-tuned, giving an almost ethereal quality.

After what is kind of the second verse, the comforting house samples fade, and the song devolves into an instrumental breakdown that can only be described as dubstep with harder synths and more musical direction. The drums play a standard 4/4 groove, keeping the listener grounded. The vocals don't bother to join back in, letting this crazy cacophony take us to the end of the track.

11. **Don't Know What You Want**

Those who read my review of the song "Tight Knot" on the album *Fat Night* will already know my problem with this song is its lack of lyrical diversity. I've counted this time as well, and the singer repeats the line "Don't know what you want" 17 times! However, there is at least some stagnation mitigation here; although the singer doesn't get any louder with each repetition, the singer's voice gets more distorted throughout the track.

The most significant issue with this track isn't the lyrics. The real problem is that, like a bad [Shaggy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaggy_Rogers#Marijuana_usage) impression, the track is only *half*-baked. There are some good ideas floating around in there, but it isn't actually an entire song, just a first draft.

12. **Fountain**

Similar to earlier songs, this song also contrasts pure and distorted harmony. In this case, a concert piano accompanies a vocal track with subtle distortion effects.

There is an 8-measure gap between verses, which features simple a cappella singing. The singers add color to their chords, not by changing any of the notes previously sung, but by adding more notes on top. More importantly, this gap features finger-snapping, which remains one of my favorite hobbies.

This song is a nice palette cleanser for the hyperpop that preceded it; overall, it is a fitting conclusion.

## Conclusion

I often hear the notion that music made solely through electronic means is soulless. "Soft Rock" makes this debate null. Last week's album, "Crooked Tree," is more sterile than "Soft Rock" by an order of magnitude.

Compared to its contemporaries, "Soft Rock" does an excellent job keeping a cohesive feel throughout its songs. "Soft Rock" achieves this by keeping many of the same synth patches between tracks, leading to consistent "instrumentation."

"Soft Rock" is an album mainly composed of synths and samples. This means that the overall soundscape it creates is paramount to having an album that feels good, regardless of harmonic, melodic, or even rhythmic content. In this regard, "Soft Rock" is consistently on point. I spent multiple songs raving about a particular synth bass patch. No instrument ever poked out from the mix in a distracting manner, and the timbre of every instrument was always created with a clear intention. The album is also full of many clever production tricks. My favorite is when the vocal track is doubled up, and one set of vocals is left undisturbed while many audio effects are applied to the other.

Besides a few real stinkers, almost every track on the album is worthy of at least some praise; this consistency earns it a score of four stars.
