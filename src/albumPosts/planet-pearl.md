## Provenance

I was listening to [this](https://www.subpop.com/news/2024/07/24/sub_pop_announces_the_release_of_like_someone_i_know_a_celebration_of_margo_guryan) Margo Guryan tribute album recently.
It's a fun listen in and of itself because each song is written and performed by a different artist, but all songs are supposed to be thematically the same (Margo Guryan tribute-themed, *duh*).
But I'm getting ahead of myself.
While listening, I particularly enjoyed a song by a band called Pearl & The Oysters. I went to investigate, and here we are.

## Why I Like It

If you're already listening along, you'll probably agree that *Planet Pearl* is much lighter than what I shared last week.
I don't mean that as a dig to either album, but *Planet Pearl* is just an easy listen, so easy, I've had it on repeat the past few days.
One of the things I appreciate most about the album, and I suspect is at least part of the reason it's such an easy listen, is that the band seems to have been laser-focused on the aesthetic they wanted for their album, and the execution was brilliant.
Everything from the album cover to the retro synths, the lyrics, and the short elevator music-esque interlude tracks(*Phototropic* and *Feed the Meter*) contributes to this 'extra-terrestrial' vibe.

Despite the deep aesthetic consistency, the tracks never become too stale.
Every song is unique art in its own right, but the transition to the next track is never jolting.
I find the musical variance most apparent in the bass lines of the tracks.
Bass lines are usually pretty simple, so it's easy to end up with very same-y lines, but each new song brings something new and compelling to my ears.

If you don't have time for a whole album, here are a few standout tracks:

* *Halfway Where?* has an odd, off-kilter drum beat. Maybe the stumbling drums are a metaphor for the singer's confusion and disorientation; maybe the drums are just cool.

* *Triangular Girl* is a straight-up jazz waltz with what, I *think*, is a sitar coming in to pick up the melody at times--how jazz is that?!

* *Mid City*'s beginning is acoustic enough to be somewhat at odds with the rest of the album's aesthetic; however, as the song progresses, more electronic elements are steadily introduced, bringing us back home right before the album ends.

**Happy Listening!**
