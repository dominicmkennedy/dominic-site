# *{title}* by {credits}

## Prelude

*Fat Night* is the first studio album released by the band Fat Night. I don't care for self-titled albums. It comes off as lazy.

According to the Spotify artist page for Fat Night (posted by Fat Night), they are an indie soul band, but in the very same sentence, they misuse the word "comprised" when "composed" would have been correct. So maybe I shouldn't trust what I read on the internet.

## Tracklist

1. **Best You've Ever Had**

Fat Night has been meticulously deliberate with the first track of their first album. The tune starts with a groove that pulls many queues from the esteemed "[Love and Happiness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_and_Happiness)." After this mini-tribute, the track breaks down into a funky double-time feel. The double-time lasts for about half of the track. Then, we settle back into the original groove to finish the track.

By paying homage to one of the greatest R&B/Soul songs of all time, Fat Night expresses their commitment to making music with authentic R&B/Soul elements. But by bisecting that homage with a funky, fresh double-time swing, Fat Night also shows that they're making new music, not just rehashing sounds of the 70s.

If this track is just a taste of what's to come, color me excited.

2. **Sometimes**

I do dig the drum and bass that lead us into this tune. However, the cool groove they have created is lessened once the guitar and keyboardist join in. The tone of the keyboardist and guitarist sound too similar, making it difficult for the listener to keep track of who's who. This turns what would be a *call-and-response* pattern into a *call-and-call* pattern. While the similar instrument timbres cause the most trouble for the prominent chorus motif, they still detract from all parts of the tune.

The guitar solo is also lifeless, but it's made up for by the mega-rad instrumental breakdown that follows it.

3. **Smilin'**

**PSA:** Don't start your song with a one-measure drum fill; it sounds childish.

This time, the guitarist takes an overdriven crunchy tone while the keyboardist opts for a Rhodes sound that's clean but biting. The two players' sounds are distinct, but they have kept the bluesy style they were going for, a true win-win.

During the bridge of this track, instead of a solo, the four artists [comprising](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/comprise-vs-compose/) *Fat Night* sing a four-part harmony with tight, crunchy chord voicings. These dissonant chords make it sound like a barbershop quartet composed of Hot Topic enthusiasts (in a good way).

4. **Three Simple Words**

This vocally dominated ballad is the album's first slow and soft tune. I appreciate how reserved the band is; the keyboardist plays with a cleaner patch, and the drummer uses brushes at different points throughout the song. This reserved playing gives a stage for the vocalist to be more expressive.

The final refrain features the instruments only, but the band plays so tepidly. I want the group to go for a full-on [shout chorus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refrain#Shout_chorus). The dynamic jump-up from the more restrained playing would give the track more interest.

5. **Sweet Berry Wine**

The intro to this song sucks. I blame the guitarist, who has a stale four-bar supporting part that's repeated throughout the entire verse, every verse. The fact that it's stale and repeated is not so much the problem. The real problem is how loud and overbearing what should be a supporting part ends up being. This is due in part to the guitarist's heavy articulations. The guitarist is also panned far right in the mixâ€”a particular annoyance for headphone listeners.

The chorus is an oasis in the desert, interrupting the wretched drone of the intro. The chorus is lovely, straddling the line between relaxing and exciting. The singer lays way back in time while the rhythm section pushes it forward. The band jells hard at the chorus, and the constant push and pull on time make for a tight groove. It makes me want to kick back and drink some blackberry wine myself.

While it's true that the guitarist plays the same riff over all the verses, it is far less problematic in the later verses. As in the later verses, the guitarist occasionally deviates from the prescribed rhythm, making the line more active. Another factor helping the balance in later verses is the difference in percussion, as the drummer switches from cross-stick hits to snare hits, and a clap track is added. The louder percussion matches the guitarist's volume more evenly.

`-10 pts` for titling the song "Sweet Berry Wine" and not "Blackberry Wine"

6. **Run Rabbit, Run**

A drum set, a shaker, wood blocks, clapping, and some vague grunts solely comprise the intro to this tune. This is **the** way to set the tone for instrumental tracks. That's right, save for the grunting, this track is sans vocals. Throwing an upbeat, rhythmically intense instrumental track into the middle of an album is an excellent way to add contrast and give the listener a break.

The vibe of this track is such that it could be part of the score of the film "Baby Driver"; *almost*. Part of what's holding this tune back is the "vocals." Although the intra-track grunting adds to the energy, it could certainly stand to be more feral.

7. **The Warmth**

This track lives up to its namesake. The keyboardist creates a spectacularly cozy atmosphere through their inviting chord voicings and, more importantly, the ambiance they build with their tone and subtle amp buzz. The warm feeling from the track makes you want to curl up with a hot mug of tea (or a cold mug of blackberry wine).

The drummer seems intent on thwarting this cozy feeling the rest of the band has built. The drummer consistently plays on the back of or even behind the beat. Behind-the-beat playing is a stylistic choice for the other band members, but it's a hard no-go for the drummer. Doing so sucks all of the energy out of a song, making it feel as though it'll never end. Another nitpick on the drums: the snare drum sounds out of place. It's tuned too high and sounds tinny, putting it in an awkward spot in the mix.

8. **Tight Knot**

Starting the track with the keys sustaining a single chord for several measures while the bassist plays different notes to outline the song's chord structure is a creative touch. It helps to build up tension. The drummer takes advantage of this by releasing the harmonic tension with a percussive explosion of drums.

Once the track moves past the first verse, things fall apart with the worst chorus ever. Each chorus contains the phrase, "You got me in a tight knot." **Eight times!** I know this because I counted. There are three choruses in this track. With basic multiplication, you'll realize this means that the tune contains the same 7-word phrase 24 times. **Wrong!** The outro adds the phrase another four times just to add insult to our injury. The lyrical diversity makes the entire back half of this track unlistenable.

9. **Walk Away**

The explosive intro that kicks this track off is a great palette cleanser from the previous track. Once we move into the chorus, the keyboardist plays more sustained chords, and we can hear the instrument's tone clearly; it sounds like someone is howling out in pain. This howling gives more emotional oompf to the song's lyrics. On the second run through the chorus, the howling of the keys is now accompanied by vocalists howling out as well.

Throughout, the bassist plays a rather busy line of 16th notes. I'm impressed by how busy the bass is without getting in the way of the keys and vocals (the tune's real stars).

10. **Root Beer**

At the top of this track, the drummer elects to use stick clicks. It reminds me of someone snapping their fingers, one of my favorite hobbies. The guitarist accompanies the drummer's stick clicking and other drum-beating activities, forming a lovely motif. This motif is punctuated by the keyboardist forming a *real* call-and-response; it looks like the band has finally figured it out.

Later on in the tune, we're treated to some falsetto vocals. I was not *that* into the falsetto when it was just one band member. But as more band members joined, creating a high-pitched harmony, the band's vision became apparent, and the vocals grew on me.

`+10` points for the lyrics "ring my bell" being used as a word painting by the drummer hitting the cymbal crowns.

## Conclusion

### boons

* Everyone sings

Throughout the album, there are several instances of the entire band singing complicated harmonies together. The band is small, with only four members, and having everyone able to sing and play their instrument simultaneously effectively doubles the group's size and allows for more exciting harmonies.

* Real [Rhodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhodes_piano)

With one or two exceptions, the keyboard player's tone is on point throughout the album. Then, when I found this [live performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u16L0XRWe0U) of the group, my suspicions were confirmed. Their keyboardist is playing on an Mk I Rhodes keyboard. This piece of hardware adds to their soulful sensibilities on all tracks, with "The Warmth" benefiting the most.

### busts

* No horn players

When I think of soul music, I think of a big band with horn players, one sax, one trumpet, and one trombone; at least, the more the merrier. But I get that this isn't just a soul band. It's an *indie* soul band. For a studio album, I'd like to see you write in some horn parts and hire some studio musicians. Most songs on the album sounded *fine* as is, but adding some brass in there would add much more energy. Examples of modern soul/R&B bands utilizing horn players are [Sir Woman](https://www.sirwoman.com/) and [The Dip](https://www.thedipmusic.com/).

* No [Purdie shuffle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj6o4cxWgl8)

I just listened to an entire funky, soul-forward album that took lots of cues from the R&B from decades past. I expected the infamous Purdie Shuffle to appear on at least one track. Now I'm just disappointed `:(`.

### Rating

*Fat Night* easily gets three stars from me. The album is mostly fun and usually not too kitschy. For their first album, it's stylistically consistent from the first track to the last. The band should continue to listen to and draw inspiration from the great soul artists that came before them. Adding some of these elements would elevate the musical maturity of the group.
