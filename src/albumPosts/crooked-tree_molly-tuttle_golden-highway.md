## Tracklist

1. **She’ll Change**

All band members play the downbeat of measure one of song one. This well-coordinated uni-note beginning gives a high-energy start. After the second chorus, the band smoothly transitions to half the original tempo for the bridge. The band maintains great musical tension throughout the bridge despite the reduced tempo. At its conclusion, the band flicks back to the original tempo without stalling or hitching. She'll Change... *tempo*.

2. **Flatland Girl** *featuring Margo Price*

I would like to see Margo featured more prominently; she hardly sings any lyrics and doesn't play guitar for the recording. Besides that, I like the step-wise motion the bass and guitar use to take the listener into every chorus. The song is a little drab.

3. **Dooley’s Farm** *featuring Billy Strings*

During the song, the lyrical rhythm is primarily 8th notes. Meanwhile, the instruments, save for fills, play quarter notes. This rhythmic discrepancy highlights the lyrics while allowing the instruments to surround us with a rich, sinister atmosphere.

In the top half of the song, Molly divulges the extent of Dooley's crimes. The proceeding solo section is longer due to the reduced tempo, which ends up being a nice touch as it builds suspense around the status of our protagonist. When the solo section ends, so does Dooley's jig. Now, Molly is to continue in the family business. I'm excited to hear what happens in "Dooley's Farm II."

The pronunciation of Vietnam is almost as bad as Peach Pits' pronunciation of Gullitine.

4. **Big Backyard** *featuring Old Crow Medicine Show*

This song features the Old Crow Medicine Show band, meaning the addition of drums and harmonica to the mix. Bluegrass is littered with complicated rhythms that weave in and out of each other; this track is no exception. The additional instruments strike the balance of making themselves known without encroaching on the territory of the existing ones. The harmonica further fleshes out the chord structure by adding harmonic accompaniment (almost like it's in the name). And the drummer adds much pep to the tune via some rhythmic motivation.

The song's disapproval of [NIMBY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIMBY) legislation wouldn't be quite so thinly veiled if not for the title; maybe pointedness was the point.

5. **Crooked Tree**

I don't like album-titled songs, but it's better than a self-titled album. I do, however, like the banjo taking on a rhythmically supporting riff. An argument could be made that the whimsy of the banjo's riff symbolically supports the song's ethos (I'm not going to make it, though). The mandolin enforces time by faithfully plucking on every single offbeat. I'm sure the [mandolinist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mandalorian) is bored, but it kept the energy in the song.

I didn't know toothpicks were a defining feature of capitalism.

6. **Castilleja**

The mood is set by a lengthy guitar and mandolin prelude. It almost sounds like the mandolin is running from the guitar. *Almost*. For a song titled after a [flower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castilleja), you may have expected this to be a slow, swooning, (simping) ballad. Instead, it has a firey tone, a heightened tempo, and a melodic line delivered by a flurry of sixteenth notes.

The fiery nature continues through the first verses, and the chorus concludes with a chilling threat. "if I can't steal your heart, Castilleja, I'll haunt you like a fugitive instead."

Like in "Dooley's Farm," the listener must let these words steep as the guitar takes a solo. It is the pick-master shred-fest I love to hear. It's by far the busiest solo in the album and dense with almost no rests, almost like how Molly won't rest until the heart of Castilleja is won.

The second verse obviously mirrors the first two, both harmonically and melodically. But the lyrics punch above their weight, adding to the visceral nature of the song.

7. **The River Knows**

The song of unrequited love is tired and overused. This makes it all the more refreshing when I hear what was a worn-out trope from the reverse perspective. Molly nails small details that add a chilling atmosphere to the song of betrayal. An example is the guitar picking, which is so percussive it gives off a palpable sense of anxiety.

8. **Over the Line** *featuring Sierra Hull*

Sierra Hull shows her mandolin prowess by keeping up with Molly's intense guitar lines while the tempo is absolutely cranked. Molly's vocal display is also a standout feature in this track. Her voice keeps pace with the tempo, which is more impressive, considering she doesn't sound rushed or sacrifice clarity.

The band has managed to squeeze an incredible amount of excitement from a song about road-tripping.

9. **Nashville Mess Around**

The mandolin takes the main melody, which is a simple one, giving the song a modest vibe. This is probably to fit the song, which was about going from a small town to a big city to party. That is until verse three when the lyrics drop this bomb of a third verse.

> So all you pals and pilgrims, and in from out of towners
> We had a boom now there's no room, so don't you hang around here
> You're out of luck, so don't pick up when Nashville comes a-calling
> You best go back to Fond du Lac and quit your honky tonking

I'm unironically upset a 2015 California transplant is gatekeeping moving to Nashville. I also doubt "out of towners" come from [cities with less than 50,000 people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fond_du_Lac,_Wisconsin).

10. **San Francisco Blues** *featuring Dan Tyminski*

This recording features Dan Tyminski's rich, soulful voice, *kind of*. Dan only harmonizes during limited portions of the choruses, while in the verses and bridge, Molly sings solo. Having Molly take verse one and the bridge while Dan sings verse two would add considerable balance to the song. It would also add credence to the lyrics, "crash of '08", which occurred when Molly was 15.

On the rhythm side of things, I'm normally happy to hear a waltz (any departure from 4/4 time is appreciated). However, the song has no rhythmic motivation; paired with the mopey lyrics, the recording lacks energy. I'd imagine it feels like waltzing with a corpse, but I don't know how to waltz; so unclear.

11. **Goodbye Girl**

Is saying "where the city meets the sea" the only way to make Boston appealing to the average bluegrass enjoyer? Otherwise, there's little of note in this track.

12. **Side Saddle** *featuring Gillian Welch*

The banjo intro for this track is really sick, and I was hoping that the banjo would carry the melody throughout the tune. Unfortunately, this song's melodic delivery device is again Molly's guitar. At this point in the album, I'm exhausted from hearing many same-y tracks that don't stand out from the crowd.

`-10 points` because horse-girl.

13. **Grass Valley**

The ambient hum of the [dobro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobro), along with the descriptive lyrics, paints a picture that transports me to "the campgrounds of grass valley." Equal parts, wholesome and serene. A bluegrass song reminiscing on the time that was spent learning bluegrass is the kind of meta-bluegrass villain origin story to conclude an album with.

## Conclusion

Molly Tuttle is the Tim Henson of Bluegrass. It's not just that she can shred but that her shredding is fluid and effortless. The same can be said about her vocal prowess, too. Making songs like "Castilleja" invigorating yet beautiful.

The album goes out of its way to feature many other artists, but more often than not, the featured artist just sings a line or two for the choruses. When Jacob Collier features Ty Dolla $ign on "... All I Need," I hear the two artists' distinct styles come together for a musical mash-up. "Big Backyard" did an okay job in this respect, but every other feature failed miserably.

Many of the weaker tracks on this album wouldn't be so bad in a vacuum, but when I feel like I've heard the same song 8 times already, it turns me off the whole album. Molly already features many talented musicians with styles differing from hers; she should lean into that to give much more variety to the album.

Even if there were no external features on the album, Molly is still surrounded by a band that's highly talented in its own right. The inter-track variety could come from having a tune where the guitar takes a backseat and the banjo takes the melody instead. Too often, the fiddle is relegated to playing ambient background tones. Giving the fiddle player more credit and more melody might help. But no one has it worse than the bassist, who is always stuck with the mind-numbingly boring "play quarter notes on beats two and four" job. Please just give the bass something fun for just one song.

For the above grievances *Crooked Tree* gets 1.5 stars from me.
