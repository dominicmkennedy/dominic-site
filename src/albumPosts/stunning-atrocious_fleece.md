# *{title}* by {credits}

I apologize for my review being a week late (especially with no notice). There's no excuse; now there's a precedent.

-- Dominic

## Tracklist

1. **All My Money**

The song has a slow and simple start; when we reach the chorus, everything changes. The band absolutely nails the ethereal, floating feeling. The melodic instruments get drenched in reverb while the bass drum continues to bring steady hits. They've managed to sneak a sax into the mix.

**Spoiler alert**: this song is a perfect thesis statement for the upcoming album.

2. **Like It A Lot**

I enjoy that we've gotten a rowdier feeling track for the second entry in this album; it's a good way for the band to show off their range.

The bass synth focuses on phat quarter note hits instead of a lighter, funkier, syncopated line that I might expect. The unusual bass idea gives the track an aura of freedom and fun. Considering how heavy the hits are, the bass would sound better with a raunchier, gritter patch, or better yet, have a baritone sax or even bass trombone come into the studio to record those phat quarter note hits.

The song also adds both a bridge and breakdown with very different vibes than what is felt in the verse and chorus sections. Leveraging these additional sections breaks up what otherwise might have become a monotonous song.

3. **Upside Down**

Adding trumpets is almost a nice touch to the track, but their parts are written far too low in the trumpet register for them to sound good. Instead of the sharp, piercing tone I enjoy from a trumpet, all this track brings is a spineless, muffled mess. Rewrite their parts two octaves higher, and it'd be a whole new song.

Not that the drummer can't handle the band on his own, but the addition of the tambourine and toms gives the track some nice textural variation.

Unlike in the last track, where the synth-bass served a more nuanced role, now it only detracts from this track. It sounds slow and encumbered. This is a song where the band would greatly benefit from having an electric bass player as part of their group.

4. **Do U Mind? (Leave the Light On)**

This track has an astounding vibe. The keyboard patch has a spectral sound, and the vocal harmonies are gorgeous enough to come from above. These elements play off each other seamlessly; they keep me in a trance-like state. On the other hand, the drummer keeps militant time while playing an understated beat with a thick snare.

This contrast adds complexity to the song; the harmony would have me float away if they got the chance, and the rhythm keeps me anchored to the ground. The combined effect keeps me straddled between two diametrically opposed emotional states--a perfect fit for the song's lyrical themes.

5. **My Type (I Don't Mind)**

I **hate** the spoken lyrics during the first 3 seconds of this track; it breaks the immersion, and the voice sounds like 2012-era Smosh.

The musicians, particularly the drummer, play with less restraint than they do for the previous track. This detail adds credence to the song's lyrics. Along with the unfettered playing, the keyboard synth is slightly de-tuned, further adding to the grittiness of the music.

Most importantly, this song dovetails perfectly with the previous one on a lyrical, musical, and emotional level. Elevating the album above just a collection of songs.

6. **Something Real**

The choruses in this track have a great sound, and I particularly appreciate hearing Ennenberg's vocals; her voice is gorgeous and a nice change of pace. Unfortunately, the verses drag more than I'm willing to tolerate. The slow tempo combined with Roger's vocal tone gives the verses a distinctly whiny feeling.

The song closes with the lamest guitar solo possible. Like the verses sucked all the improvisational energy from the universe.

7. **Inner Tube**

The sounds used for this short interlude are exceptionally pleasing, but no discernable rhythm is attached, and no clear destination is in mind. This is not inherently an issue, but at over 90 seconds, this interlude is far too long to leave a listener floating around with no sense of time or place.

8. **So Long**

Beat two is an absolute party throughout the song. Having all the musicians play so emphatically on that beat injects loads of excitement into the song. The extra coordination needed to pull this off leads to some of the best gelling between bass and drummer on this album.

The dynamic increase throughout the second chorus is executed masterfully; everyone in the band is on the same page. The drummer sneakily adds dramatic fills, and the keyboardist changes synth patches, adding excitement.

9. **Love Song For The Haters**

Rogers flexes his vocal chops on this chart. He does a perfect job of sitting just behind the beat with his lyrics. The time dilation begs me to hang on his every word. Combined with Soil's in-the-pocket drumming, the behind-the-beat singing also builds intense rhythmic interest. This only adds to Roger's well-executed embellishments, such as the vocal [scoops](https://www.freemusicdictionary.com/definition/scoop/), making his performance a standout feature of the track.

Soil also has a good showing on this 6/8-based track. He puts a great deal of emphasis on beats 1 and 4, making the song feel slow and brooding. Counterintuitively, he still manages to give just as much visibility to beats 2, 3, 5, and 6. The only comparison I can think of for this contradiction is a river that seems to be flowing slowly due to a calm surface but hides a strong undercurrent.

10. **Bodies Lie**

The beginning of this song is bleh and milquetoast. I suspect the guitars are meant to sound introspective; instead, they sound lame.

The instrumental sections of the track contrast nicely with the vocal sections, likely because the instrumental sections actually sound decent. Though in both vocal and instrumental sections of the track, the bass sticks out like a sore thumb, it's too loud, its attacks are not sharp enough, and it overall just sounds clumsy.

The song feels like the artist had problems getting all the pieces to fit while it was being written, so they kept adding stuff to it until they decided it was done. The resulting song doesn't fit into the rest of the album; it's muddled and unfocused.

11. **Moving On**

The intro to this song is not enough of a hook to keep any reasonable listener engaged. Unfortunately, this carries throughout the song; most of the time, it's too sonically underwhelming to be doing anything for me. The choruses sound like the song in a cheesy, feel-good motivational movie. The verses, on the other hand, come off as whiny. This makes it difficult for the listener to care about what's going on in the song, or the song itself, for that matter.

The guitar solo is just as bad as the one in *Something Real*.

12. **Just A Sec**

This has the same vibe as the last instrumental, *Inner Tube*, but it's only a third of the length, so it doesn't overstay its welcome. It also has some true harmonic substance, ending on what I believe is an augmented chord. Why can't the band give us these rich harmonic progressions throughout the album?

13. **Why Can't We Be Alone**

Please stop including your count-offs before the song starts. It's not artsy.

This song exemplifies something the band has done excellently throughout the album: making simple songs. It's tough to create a minimalist song without it sounding unfinished. Fleece manages to avoid this with the level of polish on every instrument and the blend between instruments on a song; this is how they differentiate a finished song from a rough draft.

After the second verse but before the second chorus, Soil, the drummer, leads the charge in a drastic dynamic jump. The frustrating part of the dynamic shift is that it's not mirrored by the bass, which was inappropriately loud at the beginning of the track and has nowhere to go once the dynamic shift happens. I suspect that the synth bass plays loudly at the start of the track to compensate for its lack of bite.

The last 30 seconds of this track are super unnecessary. It sounds as if there were two outros for the track, and the band couldn't decide which one to use, so they just slapped both on, one after another. Even if that's not the case, it unnecessarily extends the track, making it sound unfocused.

14. **Losing Time**

I love the hook. The album has used the guitar relatively sparsely, making its showcase here all the more special. This intro makes me feel like I'm in an old-timey western movie shoot-out.

The bass again uses its signature quarter-note hits, so heavy this time it **demands** the tempo and chord progression from the rest of the band. The stepwise motion the bass uses only adds to its imposing nature.

Prior to the final instantiation of the chorus, the line, "And I can feel it's over and," is sung with a harmony of just a half-step apart. Adding that delectable crunch of dissonance between two (possibly overly) consonant sections.

## Conclusion

The drummer, Ethan Soil, makes this album what it is. He is the hidden MVP of the group. He shows musical restraint, never playing inappropriately loud or soft. He rhythmically anchors the group but doesn't rigidly constrain them. Any competent studio musician can do all of the above; Soil is unique because of the neo-psychedelic nature of Fleece's music. Fleece employs spectral, floating harmonies that carry the listener to another dimension. Soil's drumming keeps the listener grounded without breaking the immersion. That is why he makes the album what it is.

This group has no dedicated bassist; Rogers plays synth bass on every track. This works well for about half the album's tracks. The synth bass almost always plays a quarter-note-dominated line in lieu of some of the funkier stuff played by Fleece's "indie-psychedelic" contemporaries. It's odd, but it sounds good and gives Fleece their signature sound. The other half of the time, synth bass is just musically inappropriate. I wish one of these four incredibly talented musicians would just pick up an electric bass. It would instantly improve many of the least polished tracks on this album.

Another nitpick I have with the album is how infrequently we heard Ennenberg on vocals. It was twice, which is a shame since she has such a pure singing tone. By comparison, Rogers' voice has a downright grating tone. At times, it's even prone to sounding whiny. There is a tradeoff, though; Rogers is much more fluid with time and can achieve more emotional inflection with his singing. I just wish they harmonized together more.

As a selfish music listener, I would have the group entertain more dissonant harmonies and take on more daring time signatures. As a rational music listener, I must understand that this would likely break the psychedelic sound that Fleece has worked so hard to create. Additionally, as long as I'm making fantastical wishes, I want the drummer to take some solos. The guitar solos in this album are weak, so why not swap them with drums.

Overall, for a band with only three full-length albums, I'm astounded at the maturity of sound Fleece has cultivated. They obviously have cohesive instrumentation but also cohesive sound and cohesive musical ideas. The first track really does play like a thesis statement to a well-written essay. Each song adds a new idea, and no song sounds out of place. The group has enough musical ideas to complete 50 minutes of runtime without repeating themselves. On a smaller scale, the tracks are rarely monotonous. The band is eager to break up longer tracks with a bridge or breakdown that shifts the energy and keeps the listener engaged. Finally, the band has enough confidence in their music that they don't cram lyrics down your throat every second of every track. Instead, they include many small gaps, or a few large ones, to let their music stand independently.
