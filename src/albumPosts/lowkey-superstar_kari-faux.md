## Tracklist

1. **While God Was Sleepin’… (remix)** *feat. JID*

This song is fun. The production does a shockingly good job of sitting in the pocket (before the remix, it sounded distinctly awkward). There's good attention to detail, such as the guitar arpeggiation that plays during the choruses but backs off during the verses, giving a platform to the rappers. Speaking of, the lyrics are super tight. This is especially appreciated since it contrasts with the more laissez-faire nature of the song's production.

My chief criticism of this song is that although it is well-written, focused, and witty, the verses are longer. And instead of two long verses, I'd prefer to hear three shorter ones. This is likely a carryover from the original version of this song without JID, which only has one verse.

2. **Stickup! (remix)** *feat. Jazz Cartier*

Kari starts the first verse with dense lyrical rhythm (almost no rests). She keeps the pressure up by increasing the speed of the lyrical delivery throughout the verse, sometimes only giving a 16th note to syllables.

The first verse doesn't just do well because of the speed with which Kari raps but also because the lyrics themselves are well-written. Unfortunately, the chorus only provides the former. Without good lyrics, the tension fizzles out. The chorus attempts to atone for this sin with cheap tricks like increasing the bass drum volume or introducing an ethereal chorus of background singers. And to some degree, these adjustments help.

Jazz Cartier does an outstanding job recapturing the listeners' attention in the second verse. The lyrical density isn't anywhere near the amount found in verse one, but something about his vocal inflection is absolutely captivating, making for a hypnotic second verse.

The R&B-style guitar riffs found in the outro are fantastic. Something like that could really help the choruses maintain engagement.

3. **Skit**

I don't mind an interlude, but I wish it was shorter. Bonus points for setting up the next track, minus points for being too early in the album for a skit.

4. **McGrady**

This track would be well-balanced if not for the trap snare. It plays an overly gratuitous beat; to alleviate the fact it's playing too often, it has been made to sound too thin. The snare should sound more substantial and take a less-is-more approach on when to play. As of now, it just sounds like a crappy shaker.

Don't take this as an attack on the song; almost everything else about this track is perfect.

5. **Actors, Rappers & Wrestlers**

Lyrically, this song is pathetic. It says absolutely nothing; it's just vapid drivel about the plight of the famous. Not only saying nothing, the lyrics do nothing, no fun hidden meanings, no clever wordplay.

The song's production aims for an ethereal or even surreal feeling. This is evident by the lack of percussion, low tempo, and melodic instruments drenched in reverb. I assume this surreal feeling is supposed to add credence to the lyrical content of the song, to mirror the trance-like state of someone unhappy, dissociating. Instead, it's just low-energy mush with the sluggish feeling of swimming through molasses.

6. **Freakin’ n’ Ballin’ (An Ode to Big Corey)**

The lyrics are comically paradoxical for someone whose income is a direct result of how famous they are.

The pipe organ synth patch sounds like an FL Studio preset. Actually, the whole beat sounds like it was ripped from an 8-year-old FL Studio YouTube tutorial. If you're really "a menace for the paper," consider spending more money on song production.

7. **Look @ That (remix)** *feat. Baby Tate*

The production of this song is a mess. The synth patch is grating and high-pitched, while the sub-bass is mushy and droning. This leaves the mid-frequency range too open, even with the vocalists.

A redeeming quality about this song is that, with both artists singing on the choruses, the vocals fill the soundstage and give a much fuller presence.

8. **Chattin’ Shit**

The lyrics in this song are unimaginative and meaningless. The chorus is repetitive. The production does nothing to prop up this mess. Why does this song have an outro? It was long and repetitive enough as is.

Also, stop wearing(singing) your area code like a badge of honor, especially if you're from the middle of nowhere(Arkansas).

9. **Mo’ Liquor** *feat. Smino*

The eighth-note bell-esque chord arpeggiation sounds like a sped-up version of the one on Wiz Khalifa's *Black and Yellow*.

The song's production almost leans into a retro hip-hop/R&B vibe, mainly due to the shape of the bass line and guitar that comes in for the choruses. This makes the trap drum samples sound awkward and out of place. I'd much prefer to hear a real drum kit. I wish this song could be more tonally consistent because, other than that, it's one of the more listenable tracks on the album. The lyrics are as whimsical as a night out on the town, and it is the only rap song I have heard that advocates for using Uber to avoid drinking and driving.

10. **Trouble**

The bass synth in this track is perfect. It's phat, it's meaty, it bites, and it's playing a sick line. Starting this track with the bass playing solo is a great hook. And keeping it around for the remainder of the song lays a solid foundation for the rest of the beat.

The verses are equal parts well-written and goofy. Bonus points for using two of my favorite slang terms in verse two, "geeked" and "muggin'." Unfortunately, only half of the song is worth listening to since the choruses are repetitive to the point of disengaging the listener.

11. **Too Much, Too Fast** *feat. Deante' Hitchcock*

It's horrid; no notes.

12. **Rapunzel**

The intro for this track features a simulacrum of [vaporwave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaporwave). It doesn't attempt to be an earnest reproduction or even respect the genre; it's just a cheap dollar-store knock-off.

In this track, Kari sings with neither conviction nor dynamics. The droning sound of her voice is exacerbated by the fact that it is mixed too loud in the track.

## Conclusion

"Lowkey Superstar" is wildly inconsistent; tracks like *Stickup!* and *McGrady* are reasonably solid in both production and lyrics. While most other tracks were unlistenable in ways I had difficulty even putting into words. This lack of consistency makes the album sound amateur and unfocused.

A common reason tracks fell short was the choruses. I need artists to understand that a chorus can not just be you singing the exact same five words over and over, ad nauseam. This level of repetition comes off as lazy and insults your listener's sensibilities. It might have been more acceptable if the instrumentation or beat had changed between the chorus and verse, but you couldn't even be bothered to do that.

The best thing about the album is that it was an approachable listen, and the tracks were generally fun.
