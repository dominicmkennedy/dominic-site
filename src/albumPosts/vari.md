## Provenance

I recently spent one of my afternoon strolls idly listening to the music of Victor Wooten on shuffle.
Then, out of (what I had thought was) nowhere, I heard something like [Carnatic music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnatic_music).
Surely, Spotify is playing someone other than Wooten, right?
Wrong! I'm listening to a song by Varijashree Venugopal *featuring* Wooten.
But the track slaps, so I play the album from the top.

I thought I'd never heard Venugopal before, but it turns out that she was heavily featured on my most listened-to song of 2024 (*A Rock Somewhere* by Jacob Collier).
I wish I'd investigated her earlier, but here we are now.

## Worth the Listen

You should listen to this album because (other than being a straight banger) it's likely not what you usually listen to.
Venugopal describes her music as a fusion between jazz and Carnatic music, so despite all the microtonality in Indian music, the songs are not as alien to Western ears as you may assume.
Each song is on the longer side and doesn't follow a standard form (e.g., *verse 1->chorus->verse 2->chorus->etc.*); instead, each song tells its story in a bespoke musical form.

A few album standouts:

* *Ranjani* has a mega rad instrument-only breakdown around the two-minute mark.
* *Liquid Light* is cool enough to pass as a Jacob Collier composition
* *Chasing the Horizon* shows off Venugopal's jaw-dropping vocal prowess and is (in my opinion) the most jazz-adjacent

**Enjoy!**
