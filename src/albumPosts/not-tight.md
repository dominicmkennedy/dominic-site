# *{title}* by {credits}

I cooked my collarbone skiing this Saturday, and I haven’t had surgery yet, so I’ll keep this short.

This is a good album, well worth your listening time.
The album features lots of very talented artists.
Consequently, the album’s tracks are varied and imbued with each featured artist's special touch.
My favorite tracks are *MOON* with Herbie Hancock, *TAKE A CHANCE* with Anderson.Paak, and *WOAH* with Kurt Rosenwinkel.

Enjoy!
