# Hello!

My name is Dominic Kennedy. I like to listen to music, study (and argue about) programming languages, and watch soccer closely.

Presently, I'm a Computer Science Ph.D. student at the University of Utah, where I study Type Theory and Formal Verification under [Ben Greenman](https://users.cs.utah.edu/~blg/).
